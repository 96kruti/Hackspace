                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>The project shows the density of people in a space when they indirectly interact with my artwork. It is a 
                    drawing machine which makes art on paper using networking and micro controller. It shows archives of people 
                    moving in a space in the past. Questions like how building is used through different time periods? Which route 
                    do people take to reach a specific space? Were explored that communicates the idea of present with past in a dedicated space. </p>

                <h3>Concept and Background Research</h3>
                
                <p>Every person has their instinct and they behave in the same place with different movements. The same path taken by 
                    the same person may differ daily. Also, I feel how millions of people walk through a space 
                    without realizing how that place has its history to tell. I started exploring the behavior of people in a specific 
                    building. For example, Hatchlab is quite a juxtaposition of the old and new. I realized how people like to use one way to 
                    staircase then another one. I was quite intrigued, these were when I started exploring. There were several questions in 
                    my mind that I wanted to explore. Why dont we have data that shows paths/motion people take to consciously or 
                    unconsciously? This was the initial thought.</p>
                <p>Many artists get inspired by people moving in a space, for example when we look at Marcel Duchamp's Nude Descending 
                    a Staircase from 1912, the artist has painted the motion of a person moving across a staircase which captures the 
                    essence of time and space. Though the medium of painting was oil on canvas. In many other Artists like Giacomo Balla's 
                    Dynamism of a Dog on Leash, we can notice the silhouette of a dog waging its tail, the energy can be experienced 
                    in the painting.</p>
                <p>St.James Hatchman building was initially constructed as a church but after refurbishment, it is used as
                   an exhibition space for artists. Every corner of the building has a different scale and feeling. It would be really 
                   interesting to mark the trails of people who used or visited this building without revealing their true identity. 
                   This dataset-based artwork would be archived for future users. The combination of the traditional medium of art and 
                   the strokes were created using machines. These were my practices belonging in conjunction with the 
                   traditional art and machines. The art of showing movement in real-time and then making it history was my main 
                   Idea behind the whole project.</p>

                <div class="flex-container flex-basis-full">
                    <div class="flex-item">
                        <img src="../assets/images/graph.png"/>
                    </div>
                    
                    <p>The hardware that was used in the project are as follows:<br>
                        1. Rasberry Pi pico W-(RP2040-based board)</br>
                        2. stepper motor-(Uln2003)<br>
                        3. Stepper motor driver</br>
                        4. Perfboard<br>
                        5. Jumper wires</br>
                        6. WebCam<br>
                        There were three sets of code that were used in the project:</br>
                        1. P5.js for cylinder data visualization.<br>
                        Here the data from JSON ﬁ le was converted into a basic line graph which was then edited in Illustrator to make
                        laser cut drawing for the cylinder.</br>
                        2. Arduino Code<br>
                        I have used accel stepper library examples of stepper_onerevolution to turn the motor 360 degrees. The speed at
                        which the motor rotated was adjusted by synchronizing it with the computer vision code.</br>
                        3.P5.js code<br>
                        A separate particle class was created to add acceleration and velocity to the particles. The color of the 
                        particles also modiﬁ es the color it’s tracking. The laws of force are used to create these multi-agents system
                        interaction </br></p>

                <h3>Reflection and Future Development</h3>
                <p>The animation of the particles revolving around the color looks very simple and basic, I would like to create more 
                    interesting graphics by simulating the number of particles depending on the data. In addition, I would also like to 
                    add more physical simulations like when two particles strike each other, the repulsion force it creates will look 
                    quite interesting. I would also like to project these graphics on the physical object using the projector. The main 
                    challenge for these will be using 
                    computer vision and projection mapping together.
                    Furthermore, I would like to develop the cylinder into a more complex 3d artifact that will rotate in different direc-
                    tions with distinct speed limits</p>
