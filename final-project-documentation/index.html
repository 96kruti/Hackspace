                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>Hunger is an interactive artwork installation between a computer and a physical object which is in motion. It 
                    provides information regarding the world hunger crisis in different continents for the past 5 years. The user can 
                    select the continent and the camera will detect color using computer vision, lot of circles that resemble people
                    ﬁghting for food in a given year will revolve around the circles showing the hunger crisis.</p>

                <h3>Concept and Background Research</h3>
                
                <p>Many artists in the past have used food crises as inspiration to build their art work using data. For example, 
                    artists from Somerville, Massachusetts turned data on food security into art by making a sculpture of stainless 
                    steel utensils on a table, where each of the 1659 households in their locality is represented by one knife, spoon, 
                    or fork. 
                    In the past many years, data has been a source of inspiration for many artists. They have converted boring num-
                    bers into physical artifacts. One such collection of artifacts can be reviewed in “http://dataphys.org/list/” which 
                    shows the list of different data visualization techniques. These inspired me to explore more into this topic of 
                    physical visualization.</p>
                <p>I come from a country where food insecurity and hunger are one of the challenges people face on an everyday 
                    basis. But covid worsened the situation as migrant workers in India were struggling to make there ends meet. 
                    While looking at the data by “our world in data.org” I went through some big numbers that it is faced by millions 
                    of people all around the world. According to data one in four suffered insecurity in 2017. The most affected ar-
                    eas are South Asian and sub-Saharan Africa. The graph shows the number of undernourished individuals around 
                    the world in the past two decades. It indicates the total number of undernourished has been steadily falling. 
                    However, we can see the change in trend increased by 663 million in 2017. South Asian countries have the high-
                    est number of malnourished individual in 2021. </p>
                <p>The Idea<br>
                    While looking at the data it did not interpret the scale or emotion that people can connect. I thought of 
                    representing it by adding small animation on top of this graph to make it more interactive. Please refer to 
                    the stages to understand the artifact.</br>
                    Stage:1<br>
                    1. Collection of data in the form of a CSV ﬁle.</br>
                    2. These data were then represented using p5.js. The initial data was in CSV but I have included only some 
                    important countries and converted that data into a JSON ﬁ le. Also Initially I was planning to use data from the 
                    past 10 years but due to space restrictions, I could just include data from the past 5 years. The selection of the 
                    continent was a purely personal decision where I analyzed the highest differences between different parts of the 
                    world.<br>
                    3. The graph was printed on paper and folded into the cylinder.</br>
                    Stage:2<br>
                    1. Particles were simulated inside a p5.js sketch having different properties like velocity, acceleration and it 
                    tracked the color that was selected using a mouse.</br>
                    Stage:3<br>
                    1. The cylinder was installed on a stepper motor that rotated in a clockwise direction at a constant speed.</br>
                    2. Webcam was placed at a distance that tracked the colors on the p5.js sketch.<br>
                    3. Circles, (representation of hungry people ﬁghting for food) can be seen on the computer screen at a selected 
                    color.</br></p>

                <div class="flex-container flex-basis-full">
                    <div class="flex-item">
                        <img src="../assets/images/graph.png"/>
                    </div>
                    
                    <p>The hardware that was used in the project are as follows:<br>
                        1. Rasberry Pi pico W-(RP2040-based board)</br>
                        2. stepper motor-(Uln2003)<br>
                        3. Stepper motor driver</br>
                        4. Perfboard<br>
                        5. Jumper wires</br>
                        6. WebCam<br>
                        There were three sets of code that were used in the project:</br>
                        1. P5.js for cylinder data visualization.<br>
                        Here the data from JSON ﬁ le was converted into a basic line graph which was then edited in Illustrator to make
                        laser cut drawing for the cylinder.</br>
                        2. Arduino Code<br>
                        I have used accel stepper library examples of stepper_onerevolution to turn the motor 360 degrees. The speed at
                        which the motor rotated was adjusted by synchronizing it with the computer vision code.</br>
                        3.P5.js code<br>
                        A separate particle class was created to add acceleration and velocity to the particles. The color of the 
                        particles also modiﬁ es the color it’s tracking. The laws of force are used to create these multi-agents system
                        interaction </br></p>

                <h3>Reflection and Future Development</h3>
                <p>The animation of the particles revolving around the color looks very simple and basic, I would like to create more 
                    interesting graphics by simulating the number of particles depending on the data. In addition, I would also like to 
                    add more physical simulations like when two particles strike each other, the repulsion force it creates will look 
                    quite interesting. I would also like to project these graphics on the physical object using the projector. The main 
                    challenge for these will be using 
                    computer vision and projection mapping together.
                    Furthermore, I would like to develop the cylinder into a more complex 3d artifact that will rotate in different direc-
                    tions with distinct speed limits</p>
