                <h1>Flow of Energy</h1>
                <p>The motion of energy particles in universe.</p> 
                <p>The project explores the idea of particles and their relation with each other. Here the sun (on the left side) acts 
                    as a gravitational force that attracts the matter towards them and gives out energy. Also, the particles decrease 
                    the trail as it reaches near the sun, this shows the immense amount of energy that is produced by the sun. The 
                    color of the particles also resembles energy.</p>
